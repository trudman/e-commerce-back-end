# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

This project was my Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End application. This project was very challenging to become increasingly more comfortbale with the backend development. This was very helpful for me to use the ORM in order to layout my application. I was able to build upon previous knowledge gained throughout this program to create ddifferent routes in order to access data. This also built upon our use of databases. Overall, this was a very challenging project but I feel like I was able to become much more familiar and comfortable with back end devlopment.
